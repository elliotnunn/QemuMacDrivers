MacsBug
=======

MacOS debuggers run with all 68k interrupts disabled (except NMI). This prevents a timer interrupt from being used to refresh the screen. (MacsBug does not use QuickDraw, so we cannot intercept QuickDraw calls).

Therefore we patch the 68k DebugUtil trap, specifically the DebugPoll selector, which MacsBug calls in a tight loop. The patch updates the entire screen.
